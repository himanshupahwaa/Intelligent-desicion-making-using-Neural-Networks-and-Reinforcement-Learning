# Intelligent-desicion-making-using-Neural-Networks-and-Reinforcement-Learning
As you can tell by the title of this repo, it consists of two parts, reinforcement learning and neural networks. In the first part, we use Markov's decision process and value iteration to derive the best utility value at each state. Therefore the agent always knows the best decision to take for survival at each step (state).
 In the second part we solve the same problem by building neural networks, selecting features for different scenarios, building each component of the neural network from scratch without any pre defined python libraries. We explain the research done in order to reach a high level of accuracy.

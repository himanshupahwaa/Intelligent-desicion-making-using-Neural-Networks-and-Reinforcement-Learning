# Intelligent-desicion-making-using-Neural-Networks-and-Reinforcement-Learning
As you can tell by the title of this repo, it consists of two parts, reinforcement learning and neural networks. In the first part, we use Markov's decision process to derive the best utility value at each state. And then we utilize neural networks to derive another set of utility values. Then the results are compared.
